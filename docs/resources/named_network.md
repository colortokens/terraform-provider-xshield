  named_network_description = "...my_named_network_description..." # Description of the named network
  
  # IP ranges to include in this named network
  ip_ranges = [
    {
      ip_range = "192.168.1.0/24" # CIDR notation for the IP range
    },
    {
      ip_range = "10.0.0.0/16"   # Another IP range example
    }
  ]
  
  # Additional settings
  program_as_intranet = false              # Whether to treat programs as intranet traffic
